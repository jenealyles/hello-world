# hello-world

Hello Everyone,

My name is Je'Nea and I'm interested in coding. For the past couple of years, I thought about learning how to code for awhile and recently with the push of Power BI and other power apps along with the my job's compliance with the stay at home order, I have additional time on my hands to learn.

I can't wait to learn things I can take back and utilize at work when it's time.
